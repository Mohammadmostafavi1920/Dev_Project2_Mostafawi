Poverty and Inequality in HEIS and Welfare data of Iran 
This project, uses 2 percent welfare ministary data and HEIS of Islamic Republic of Iran and tries to find patterns of inequality and poverty in province level. 
In this project, I show that there is a correlation between poverty and inequality in province level. I have used many interactive maps to show this patterns in the best possible way. 
Since the HTML file was 50MG, I changed it to zip and then uploaded it.
